(defvar *drakma-default-external-format* ':latin-1
  "The default value for the external format keyword arguments of
HTTP-REQUEST.  The value of this variable will be interpreted by
FLEXI-STREAMS.  The initial value is the keyword :LATIN-1.
(Note that Drakma binds *DEFAULT-EOL-STYLE* to :LF).")

(defvar *header-stream* nil
  "If this variable is not NIL, it should be bound to a stream to
which incoming and outgoing headers will be written for debugging
purposes.")

(defvar *allow-dotless-cookie-domains-p* nil
  "When this variable is not NIL, cookie domains containing no dots
are considered valid.  The default is NIL, meaning to disallow such
domains except for \"localhost\".")

(defvar *ignore-unparseable-cookie-dates-p* nil
  "Whether Drakma is allowed to treat `Expires' dates in cookie
headers as non-existent if it can't parse them.  If the value of this
variable is NIL \(which is the default), an error will be signalled
instead.")

(defvar *remove-duplicate-cookies-p* t
  "Determines how duplicate cookies in the response are handled,
defaults to T.  Cookies are considered duplicate using COOKIE=.  Valid
values are:

 NIL - duplicates will not be removed,
 T or :KEEP-LAST - for duplicates, only the last cookie value will be kept, based on the
 order of the response header,
 :KEEP-FIRST - for duplicates, only the first cookie value will be kept, based on the order of the response
 header.

Misbehaving servers may send duplicate cookies back in the
 same Set-Cookie header:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: My-hand-rolled-server
Date: Wed, 07 Apr 2010 15:12:30 GMT
Connection: Close
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 82
Set-Cookie: a=1; Path=/; Secure, a=2; Path=/; Secure

In this case Drakma has to choose whether cookie 'a' has the value '1'
or '2'.  By default, Drakma will choose the last value specified, in
this case '2'.  By default, Drakma conforms to RFC2109 HTTP State
Management Mechanism, section 4.3.3 Cookie Management:

    If a user agent receives a Set-Cookie response header whose NAME
    is the same as a pre-existing cookie, and whose Domain and Path
    attribute values exactly \(string) match those of a pre-existing
    cookie, the new cookie supersedes the old.")

(defvar *text-content-types* '(("text" . nil))
  "A list of conses which are used by the default value of
*BODY-FORMAT-FUNCTION* to decide whether a 'Content-Type' header
denotes text content.  The car and cdr of each cons should each be a
string or NIL.  A content type matches one of these
entries (and thus denotes text) if the type part is STRING-EQUAL
to the car or if the car is NIL and if the subtype part
is STRING-EQUAL
to the cdr or if the cdr is NIL.

The initial value of this variable is the list

\((\"text\" . nil))

which means that every content type that starts with \"text/\" is
regarded as text, no matter what the subtype is.")

(defvar *body-format-function* 'determine-body-format
  "A function which determines whether the content body returned by
the server is text and should be treated as such or not.  The function
is called after the request headers have been read and it must accept
two arguments, headers and external-format-in, where headers is like
the third return value of HTTP-REQUEST while external-format-in is the
HTTP-REQUEST argument of the same name.  It should return NIL if the
body should be regarded as binary content, or a FLEXI-STREAMS external
format \(which will be used to read the body) otherwise.

This function will only be called if the force-binary argument to
HTTP-REQUEST is NIL.

The initial value of this variable is a function which uses
*TEXT-CONTENT-TYPES* to determine whether the body is text and then
proceeds as described in the HTTP-REQUEST documentation entry.")
